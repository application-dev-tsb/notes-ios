# View Controller
Two Types of View Controllers:
* Content VC
* Containter VC - has child VCs

## Root View Controller
The root view controller is the anchor of the view controller hierarchy. Every window has exactly one root view controller whose content fills that window

## Container View Controller
* UINavigationController
* UISplitViewController
* UIPageViewController
