# Internationalization and Localization
Localization is the process of translating your app into multiple languages. But before you can localize your app, you internationalize it. Internationalization is the process of making your app able to adapt to different languages, regions, and cultures. Because a single language can be used in multiple parts of the world, your app should adapt to the regional and cultural conventions of where a person resides. An internationalized app appears as if it is a native app in all the languages and regions it supports.

The App Store is available in over 150 different countries, and internationalizing your app is the first step to reach this global market. Using iTunes Connect, you specify whether your app is available in all territories or specific territories. Then you customize your app for each target market that you want to support. Users in other countries want to use your app in a language they understand and see dates, times, and numbers in familiar, regional formats.
